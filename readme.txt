Summary: 
This is the initial public release of PhysiCell: an Open Source Physics-Based 
Cell Simulator for 3-D Multicellular Systems. It is currently under scientific 
peer review. 

Major new features:
+ Simulating large systems of cells in 3-D tissues on desktop machine
+ Cells move and change based on biomechanical and physical rules
+ Built upon BioFVM to couple processes with the substrates' concentrations 
  in the microenvironment 
+ Implements multiple realistic cell cycle and cell death models
+ Performance linearly scales with the number of the cells
+ Preliminary support for MultiCellDS (http://MultiCellDS.org)
+ Includes examples for 3-D ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and hanging 
  drop tumor spheroids 

Bugfixes: 
+ Not applicable.
